[![im-sorry](http://justinvoelkel.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/im-sorry.png)](http://justinvoelkel.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/im-sorry.png)Yep, that ^ just happened. I’ve been taking a peek at my google analytics and I’ve notice quite a bit of interest in my Angular and Laravel posts. Fear not for I have not abandoned them! I’ve simply been getting married, moving, and jet setting all over this beautiful big blue globe. SO – this is simply a remind I am not dead…yet. And now that I’ve gotten all of these wonderful life altering mile stones out of the way I will be jumping back in feet first to finish my Laravel and Angular series. Part three is already half written and should be coming down the pipe extremely soon! Excuses done – kthxbaiguyz.
